# HTML-Structure-and-Basic-Server-Interaction
This project showcases how to build a well-organized HTML front-end and connect it with a basic Express server on the back-end. It's designed for beginners looking to understand how the browser communicates with the server and how to serve static files, handle form submissions, and build dynamic routes.
